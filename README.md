### Welcome to bermedDev!

My name is Fernando J. Bermúdez Medina. I am a junior Software Engineering Undegraduate Student at the **University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus**.

I am currently working as a **Teaching Assistant** for the **CIIC4020/ICOM4035** course (Data Structures) right here at UPRM

I am also actively seeking some summer intenships (or Co-Ops if any) that can allow me to increase my skills in the field of Software Engineering and Computer Science.

In this GitHub Profile you will see that I will upload some personal proyects, as well as some classwork projects from the CIIC courses I'm taking this semester.
Below is a table showing some projects I am working on that are in development or are ready to go!
Projects that are marked as **Done** have their repo's available to see in this profile, the one's that are **In Progress** are mostly private, so you'll have to wait a bit more to find out what were developing! So keep checking this profile to see what's changed and feel free to contact me any time!
